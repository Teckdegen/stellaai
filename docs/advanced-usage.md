# Advanced Usage Guide for Stella AI

This guide explains how to leverage Stella AI's advanced capabilities for creating sophisticated Clarity smart contracts.

## Writing Effective Prompts

### Be Specific and Detailed
Instead of: "Create an NFT contract"
Use: "Create an NFT contract with minting functionality, owner-only minting, transfer capabilities, and SIP-009 compliance with get-token-uri support"

### Include Security Requirements
Example: "Create a staking contract with:
- Owner-only initialization
- Time-based reward calculations
- Emergency withdrawal after 30 days
- Reentrancy protection
- Proper error handling with descriptive error codes"

### Specify Standards Compliance
Example: "Create an FT contract that follows SIP-010 with:
- Transfer function with memo support
- get-balance and get-supply functions
- Mint and burn functions (owner-only)
- Proper event logging"

## Leveraging AI-Assisted Validation

### Understanding Validation Feedback
The AI provides three types of feedback:
1. **Errors**: Issues that prevent deployment
2. **Warnings**: Best practice suggestions
3. **Fix Suggestions**: Automated solutions for common issues

### Requesting Code Improvements
You can ask Stella to improve existing code:
- "Optimize this contract for gas efficiency"
- "Add better error handling to this function"
- "Improve the security of this contract"
- "Make this contract SIP-009 compliant"

## Advanced Contract Patterns

### Complex State Management
Request contracts with sophisticated state management:
- "Create a DAO contract with proposal voting, quorum requirements, and execution delays"
- "Build a marketplace with escrow, dispute resolution, and multi-signature release"

### Cross-Contract Interactions
Ask for contracts that interact with other contracts:
- "Create a staking contract that works with my existing NFT contract"
- "Build a rewards contract that can distribute multiple token types"

### Upgradeable Contracts
Request upgradeable contract patterns:
- "Create an upgradeable NFT contract using the proxy pattern"
- "Build a contract with version management capabilities"

## Error Detection and Fixing

### Proactive Error Prevention
The AI's enhanced validation system catches issues before they become problems:
- Syntax errors (parentheses, naming, declarations)
- Semantic issues (authorization, error handling)
- Best practice violations (security, efficiency)

### Requesting Specific Fixes
You can ask for help with specific issues:
- "Fix the authorization in this function"
- "Add proper error handling to this contract"
- "Resolve the parentheses imbalance"
- "Improve the gas efficiency of this loop"

## Security-Focused Development

### Requesting Security Reviews
Ask Stella to review contracts for security:
- "Perform a security audit of this contract"
- "Identify potential reentrancy vulnerabilities"
- "Check for authorization bypasses"
- "Review for integer overflow risks"

### Implementing Security Patterns
Request contracts with specific security features:
- "Create a contract with rate limiting"
- "Build a contract with time locks"
- "Implement multi-signature authorization"
- "Add circuit breaker functionality"

## Performance Optimization

### Gas Optimization Requests
Ask for efficiency improvements:
- "Optimize this contract to reduce transaction costs"
- "Improve the storage efficiency of this contract"
- "Reduce the computational complexity of this function"

### Scalability Considerations
Request contracts designed for scale:
- "Create a contract that can handle thousands of users"
- "Build a contract with batch operation support"
- "Design a contract with efficient pagination"

## Standards Compliance

### SIP Implementation
Request contracts that follow specific standards:
- "Create an NFT contract that fully complies with SIP-009"
- "Build an FT contract with complete SIP-010 support"
- "Implement SIP-011 metadata for my NFT contract"

### Community Best Practices
Ask for contracts that follow community standards:
- "Create a contract following OpenZeppelin security patterns"
- "Build a contract with comprehensive documentation"
- "Implement industry-standard access control patterns"

## Integration and Deployment

### Wallet Integration
The AI understands wallet-based deployment:
- Contracts are designed to work with Hiro Wallet and Xverse Wallet
- Proper transaction signing patterns are implemented
- User experience considerations are included

### Network Considerations
Request contracts optimized for specific networks:
- "Create a contract optimized for Stacks Testnet"
- "Build a contract with Mainnet deployment in mind"
- "Design a contract that works on both networks"

## Iterative Development

### Refining Contracts
The AI supports iterative development:
- "Add minting functionality to this NFT contract"
- "Extend this staking contract with compound rewards"
- "Modify this marketplace to support auctions"
- "Update this contract to include whitelisting"

### Version Management
Request version-aware development:
- "Create version 2 of this contract with additional features"
- "Add backward compatibility to this contract update"
- "Design an upgrade path for this contract"

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Requesting Test Cases
Ask for testing support:
- "Generate unit tests for this contract"
- "Create integration tests for these functions"
- "Provide test scenarios for this contract"

### Quality Metrics
Request quality assessments:
- "Evaluate the code coverage of this contract"
- "Assess the security level of this contract"
- "Review the gas efficiency of this implementation"

By following these guidelines, you can leverage Stella AI's full capabilities to create professional, secure, and efficient Clarity smart contracts for the Stacks blockchain.
